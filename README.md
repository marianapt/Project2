Simple event and RSVP manager. Stop planning your parties and start *enjoying* them!

# 3 simple steps:
	* Red: Signup, login, create your event. You'll set:
		* total cost of the event
		* max cost per person
		* RSVP cutoff date
	* Yellow: Invite your friends. They will:
		*recieve an email with the invite
		*to RSVP, they will securely add their credit card information with Stripe.
	* Green: It's a go!
		* Once the max cost per person is less than or equal to what the creator set (from RSVPS), guest cards are charged!  The event is a go.  

Never be stuck paying more than you agreed upon...
